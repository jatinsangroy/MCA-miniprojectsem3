agents.py
---------
Defines all four autonomous CrewAI agents for the
Personalized Learning Path Generator system.

Agents
------
1. Profiler & Diagnostic Agent  - Evaluates skills, pinpoints knowledge gaps
2. Curriculum Designer Agent    - Structures macro-roadmap into modules/milestones
3. Resource Curation Agent      - Attaches high-quality resources to every module
4. Assessment & Adaptation Agent - Generates quizzes and adapts upcoming modules

LLM Provider
------------
Uses Groq (via LiteLLM) by default. Set GROQ_API_KEY and optionally
GROQ_MODEL in your .env file. Falls back gracefully to OpenAI if
OPENAI_API_KEY is set instead.
